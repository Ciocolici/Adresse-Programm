# Adresse Programm
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, created during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. The project allows the user to manage and store address information, including street, house number, city, and postal code. Additionally, the program can handle customer data like name, date of birth, and creditworthiness.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Adresse Programm.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
